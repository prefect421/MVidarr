## üõ† **Quick Win Scripts**

### Immediate File Permissions Fix
```bash
# Run immediately to fix critical permission issues
chmod 600 data/mvidarr.db
chmod 700 data/
chmod 600 .env 2>/dev/null || true
find . -name "*.key" -exec chmod 600 {} \;
find . -name "*.pem" -exec chmod 600 {} \;
```

### Environment Security Check
