# MVidarr Error Resolution Plan
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Total Issues to Resolve:** 6 remaining critical issues

## Implementation Priority

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: Service Infrastructure (Critical)**
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE  
**Impact:** Blocks all testing and functionality

#### Issue 1: Service Connectivity Problems
**Problem:** Flask service not consistently listening on port 5000  
**Root Cause:** Process management issues, port binding conflicts  

**Solution Steps:**
1. Add proper port checking and cleanup in service startup
2. Implement graceful service restart mechanism  
3. Add service health check endpoint
4. Fix process management to prevent multiple instances

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Add to app.py startup
def check_port_availability(port):
    import socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) != 0

# Add cleanup function
def cleanup_previous_instances():
    # Kill any existing instances before starting
```

### ðŸ”§ **PHASE 2: Backend API Implementation (High Priority)**
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Multiple bulk operations broken

#### Issue 2: Missing API Endpoints
**Problem:** Backend endpoints returning 404 errors  
**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/artists/bulk-imvdb-link`
- `/api/videos/bulk/quality-check`  
- `/api/videos/bulk/upgrade-quality`
- `/api/videos/bulk/transcode`

**Solution Steps:**
1. Identify missing endpoint implementations in backend
2. Add placeholder endpoints that return proper JSON responses
3. Implement actual functionality for each endpoint
4. Add proper error handling and validation

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to API routes
@bp.route('/api/artists/bulk-imvdb-link', methods=['POST'])
def bulk_imvdb_link():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        artist_ids = data.get('artist_ids', [])
        # Implementation logic here
        return jsonify({'success': True, 'linked_count': len(artist_ids)})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

#### Issue 3: Server Error Endpoints (500 errors)
**Problem:** Existing endpoints returning 500 internal server errors  
**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/artists/bulk-validate-metadata`

**Solution Steps:**  
1. Debug server-side error in bulk metadata validation
2. Add proper exception handling
3. Fix any database/logic errors causing 500 responses
4. Add logging for better debugging

### ðŸŽ¨ **PHASE 3: Frontend Improvements (Medium Priority)**
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** User experience and functionality

#### Issue 4: Untested Page Functionality
**Problem:** MvTV and Settings pages not fully tested  
**Root Cause:** Service connectivity issues preventing testing

**Solution Steps:**
1. Complete testing of MvTV page after service fixes
2. Complete testing of Settings page after service fixes  
3. Identify and fix any issues found during testing
4. Add proper error handling for media operations

#### Issue 5: Error Message Consistency
**Problem:** Some API calls still use old error handling patterns  
**Impact:** Inconsistent user error messages

**Solution Steps:**
1. Audit all remaining fetch() calls in templates
2. Apply consistent error handling pattern to all API calls
3. Standardize error message formatting
4. Add loading states for better UX

---

### ðŸ§ª **PHASE 4: Testing & Validation (Ongoing)**
**Priority:** ONGOING  
**Impact:** Quality assurance

#### Issue 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Problem:** Only 53% of application tested due to service issues

**Solution Steps:**
1. Fix service connectivity to enable automated testing
2. Run comprehensive test suite on all pages
3. Document all newly discovered issues
4. Create regression test suite for future changes

## Expected Outcomes

### After Phase 1 (Service Infrastructure):
- âœ… Stable service running consistently on port 5000
- âœ… Reliable service startup and shutdown
- âœ… Automated testing becomes possible

### After Phase 2 (Backend API):
- âœ… All bulk operations working properly
- âœ… No more 404/500 errors from missing/broken endpoints
- âœ… Consistent JSON responses across all APIs

### After Phase 3 (Frontend):
- âœ… 100% page functionality tested and working
- âœ… Consistent error handling and user messages  
- âœ… Improved user experience with loading states

### After Phase 4 (Testing):
- âœ… 100% test coverage achieved
- âœ… All critical issues resolved
- âœ… Application ready for production use

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **Backend API Development** - May require significant backend code changes
   - *Mitigation:* Start with placeholder endpoints, implement functionality incrementally

2. **Service Reliability** - Root cause of port issues may be complex
   - *Mitigation:* Implement multiple fallback mechanisms and better error logging

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **New Issues Discovery** - Testing may reveal additional problems
   - *Mitigation:* Allocate buffer time for unexpected issues

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Service uptime: 100% (no connection refused errors)
- [ ] API endpoint success rate: 100% (no 404/500 errors from application bugs)
- [ ] Test coverage: 100% (all pages and features tested)
- [ ] User experience: All buttons and forms working as expected
- [ ] Error handling: Consistent, user-friendly error messages throughout
