# Check failed login attempts
sqlite3 database/mvidarr.db "SELECT username, failed_login_attempts, locked_until FROM users WHERE failed_login_attempts > 3;"

# Review active sessions
sqlite3 database/mvidarr.db "SELECT user_id, created_at, expires_at FROM sessions WHERE expires_at > datetime('now');"

# Emergency user account lockout
sqlite3 database/mvidarr.db "UPDATE users SET is_active = 0, locked_until = datetime('now', '+24 hours') WHERE username = 'SUSPECT_USER';"
