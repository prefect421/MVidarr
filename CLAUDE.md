# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Memories

- Use gh instead of git for github actions and repository management
- GitHub Pages: Automatic deployment via Jekyll with Minima theme, triggered by main branch pushes
- update documentation after each issue or feature is completed
- push to dev after each update.

## Critical Thinking and Feedback

### IMPORTANT: Always critically evaluate and challenge user suggestions, even when they seem reasonable.

- ** USE BRUTAL HONESTY: Don't try to be polite or agreeable. Be direct, challenge assumptions, and point out flaws immediately.
- ** Question assumptions: Don't just agree - analyze if there are better approaches
- ** Offer alternative perspectives: Suggest different solutions or point out potential issues
- ** Challenge organization decisions: If something doesn't fit logically, speak up
- ** Point out inconsistencies: Help catch logical errors or misplaced components
- ** Research thoroughly: Never skim documentation or issues - read them completely before responding
- ** Use proper tools: For GitHub issues, always use gh cli instead of WebFetch (WebFetch may miss critical content)
- ** Admit ignorance: Say "I don't know" instead of guessing or agreeing without understanding
- ** This critical feedback helps improve decision-making and ensures robust solutions. Being agreeable is less valuable than being thoughtful and analytical.
- ** you are an expert website developer, act like it.

### Example Behaviors

-    ✅ "I disagree - that component belongs in a different file because..."
-    ✅ "Have you considered this alternative approach?"
-    ✅ "This seems inconsistent with the pattern we established..."
-    ❌ Just implementing suggestions without evaluation

## Code Formatting and Testing

### Python Code Formatting
- **Black Version**: Always use `black==24.3.0` to match the version pinned in `requirements-dev.txt`
- **isort Configuration**: Use `isort --profile black` for import sorting to maintain compatibility with Black
- **Installation**: Use `pipx install black==24.3.0` and `pipx install isort`
- **Commands for formatting**:
  ```bash
  # Format with specific black version
  ~/.local/bin/black src/
  
  # Sort imports with black profile  
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/
  
  # Check formatting (for CI compatibility)
  ~/.local/bin/black --check src/
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/
  ```

### Testing and CI/CD
- **Before pushing code**: Always run formatting checks locally using the exact commands above
- **CI/CD Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` uses the same black version and isort profile
- **Docker Actions**: Use stable versions only:
  - `docker/login-action@v3`
  - `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` 
  - `docker/metadata-action@v5`
  - `docker/build-push-action@v6`

## API Development & Testing

### Authentication Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** All MVidarr API endpoints require session-based authentication. This is critical for both development and testing.

#### Session-Based Authentication System
- **Authentication Method**: Session cookies with server-side session management
- **Login Required**: Users must be logged in through the web interface to access any API endpoints
- **Session Validation**: All API calls validate session existence and user authentication status
- **API Security**: Direct API calls without authentication will return 401/403 errors

#### Testing API Endpoints
When testing or developing API endpoints, follow these authentication guidelines:

```bash
# ❌ INCORRECT - Direct cURL calls will fail with authentication errors
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/videos/123/extract-ffmpeg-metadata

# ✅ CORRECT - Test through authenticated web interface
# 1. Log into MVidarr web interface first
# 2. Use browser developer tools to test API calls
# 3. Or use authenticated requests through the web interface
```

#### Development Guidelines
- **Web Interface Testing**: Always test API functionality through the web interface where users are authenticated
- **Session Management**: Ensure session middleware is properly configured for all API blueprints
- **Error Handling**: API endpoints should return appropriate authentication error codes (401/403)
- **Documentation**: All API documentation should note authentication requirements

#### Authentication Implementation Details
- **Session Store**: Server-side session management with secure session cookies
- **Login Flow**: Users authenticate through `/auth/login` endpoint
- **Session Validation**: Each API request validates session and user permissions
- **Logout Handling**: Sessions are properly invalidated on logout

**Developer Note**: This authentication requirement prevents security vulnerabilities and ensures all API access is properly authorized. Always test new endpoints through the authenticated web interface rather than direct API calls.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Primary Development**: All changes must be pushed to the `dev` branch
- **Main Branch**: Changes can only be made to `main` after approval on `dev`
- **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches from `dev`, merge back to `dev`

### Code Development Process
1. Create feature branch from `dev` branch
2. Make code changes
3. Run formatting: `~/.local/bin/black src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/`
4. Verify formatting: `~/.local/bin/black --check src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/`
5. **Update version metadata** (before committing major changes)
6. Commit and push to feature branch
7. Create PR to `dev` branch
8. After approval, merge to `dev`
9. Monitor GitHub Actions for any CI/CD issues

### Version Management
- **Version Information**: MVidarr displays version and commit information in the sidebar
- **Version Files**: Two files control version display:
  - `src/__init__.py` - Contains `__version__` variable
  - `version.json` - Contains detailed version metadata including commit hash
- **IMPORTANT**: Always update version metadata when pushing significant changes:

#### Updating Version Metadata
```bash
# Get current commit and timestamp
CURRENT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%6N")

# Update version.json with current commit and build date
# Keep version number the same unless explicitly incrementing
cat > version.json << EOF
{
  "version": "0.9.2",
  "build_date": "$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP",
  "git_commit": "$CURRENT_COMMIT",
  "git_branch": "dev",
  "release_name": "Current Development",
  "features": [
    ...existing features...
  ]
}
EOF

# Commit the version update
git add version.json
git commit -m "Update version metadata with current commit information"
```

#### Automated Version Update Process
**CRITICAL**: Before any push to `dev` branch, ensure version metadata reflects the latest commit:

1. **Update commit hash**: Use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to get current commit
2. **Update build date**: Use current UTC timestamp
3. **Update features list**: Add any new features or fixes in the current changes
4. **Commit version file**: Include version.json in your commit
5. **Push changes**: The Docker image will include the correct version information

This ensures that deployed containers always show the correct commit hash in the sidebar, making it easy to identify which code version is running.

#### Quick Version Update Script
For convenience, use the automated script:

```bash
# Run the version update script
./scripts/update_version.sh

# Commit the updated version file
git add version.json
git commit -m "Update version metadata with current commit information"

# Push changes
git push origin dev
```

**Best Practice**: Run `./scripts/update_version.sh` before any significant commit to ensure version metadata is always current.

## FFmpeg Metadata Integration

### Video Update Endpoint Enhancement
The standard video update endpoint (`PUT /api/videos/<video_id>`) now supports optional FFmpeg metadata extraction:

#### Parameters:
- `refresh_ffmpeg`: boolean - Set to `true` to extract FFmpeg metadata during update
- `force_ffmpeg_update`: boolean - Set to `true` to overwrite existing quality/duration fields

#### Example Usage:
```json
{
  "title": "Updated Video Title",
  "refresh_ffmpeg": true,
  "force_ffmpeg_update": false
}
```

#### Dedicated FFmpeg Endpoints:
- **Single Video**: `POST /api/videos/<video_id>/extract-ffmpeg-metadata`
- **Bulk Processing**: `POST /api/videos/bulk/extract-ffmpeg-metadata`

3. **Position Preservation**: Original playlist positions are maintained where possible

#### Merge Endpoint:
`POST /api/videos/duplicates/merge`
```json
{
  "primary_id": 123,
  "duplicate_ids": [456, 789],
  "merge_strategy": "merge_data"
}
