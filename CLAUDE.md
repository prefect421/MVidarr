# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Memories

- Use gh instead of git for github actions and repository management

## Code Formatting and Testing

### Python Code Formatting
- **Black Version**: Always use `black==24.3.0` to match the version pinned in `requirements.txt`
- **isort Configuration**: Use `isort --profile black` for import sorting to maintain compatibility with Black
- **Installation**: Use `pipx install black==24.3.0` and `pipx install isort`
- **Commands for formatting**:
  ```bash
  # Format with specific black version
  ~/.local/bin/black src/
  
  # Sort imports with black profile  
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/
  
  # Check formatting (for CI compatibility)
  ~/.local/bin/black --check src/
  ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/
  ```

### Testing and CI/CD
- **Before pushing code**: Always run formatting checks locally using the exact commands above
- **CI/CD Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` uses the same black version and isort profile
- **Docker Actions**: Use stable versions only:
  - `docker/login-action@v3`
  - `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` 
  - `docker/metadata-action@v5`
  - `docker/build-push-action@v6`

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Primary Development**: All changes must be pushed to the `dev` branch
- **Main Branch**: Changes can only be made to `main` after approval on `dev`
- **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches from `dev`, merge back to `dev`

### Code Development Process
1. Create feature branch from `dev` branch
2. Make code changes
3. Run formatting: `~/.local/bin/black src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black src/`
4. Verify formatting: `~/.local/bin/black --check src/ && ~/.local/bin/isort --profile black --check-only src/`
5. Commit and push to feature branch
6. Create PR to `dev` branch
7. After approval, merge to `dev`
8. Monitor GitHub Actions for any CI/CD issues

## Project Management

### MVidarr Roadmap
- **Project Board**: https://github.com/users/prefect421/projects/1
- All development should be guided by the MVidarr Roadmap project board
- Issues should be prioritized and planned according to their position on the roadmap

### Issue Management
All issues should be planned with the following attributes:
- **Milestone**: Correlates to version number being released
- **Release Slot**: Designated release window for the issue
- **Start Date**: When work on the issue should begin
- **Stop Date**: Target completion date for the issue

### Release Management
- **Current Release**: Version 0.9.1
- **Versioning**: Milestones correlate directly to version numbers
- Releases are now utilized for version management and deployment

## Security Implementation

### Comprehensive Security Audit - Phase I Complete ✅
- **Date Completed**: July 28, 2025
- **Total Vulnerabilities Fixed**: 17 (1 Critical, 2 High, 12 Medium, 2 Low)
- **Security Documentation**: See `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` for complete details

### Critical Security Fixes Applied
- **PyMySQL 1.1.0 → 1.1.1**: Fixed SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-36039)
- **Gunicorn 21.2.0 → 23.0.0**: Fixed HTTP request smuggling (CVE-2024-1135, CVE-2024-6827)
- **Pillow 10.1.0 → 10.3.0**: Fixed buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2024-28219)
- **Requests, urllib3, Werkzeug**: Updated to latest secure versions
- **All Dependencies**: Comprehensive security-focused updates in requirements.txt

### Automated Security Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Security Scan Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
  - Daily automated security audits (2 AM UTC)
  - Multi-tool security scanning (pip-audit, safety, bandit, semgrep, trivy)
  - SARIF integration with GitHub Security tab
  - 90-day artifact retention for security reports

- **Enhanced CI/CD Security**: 
  - Security checks required for all merges to main branch
  - Real-time vulnerability detection on dependency changes
  - Branch protection with security enforcement
  - Automated GitHub issue creation for critical findings

### Security Tools & Monitoring
- **pip-audit**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Safety**: Known security vulnerability database checking
- **Bandit**: Static analysis for common Python security issues  
- **Semgrep**: Advanced security pattern matching (OWASP Top 10)
- **Trivy**: Filesystem and container vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Tab**: Centralized vulnerability tracking and SARIF reporting

### Security Workflow Commands
```bash
# Run local security audit (matches CI environment)
pip-audit --requirement=requirements.txt --desc
safety check --requirement=requirements.txt
bandit -r src/ -f json
semgrep --config=p/security-audit src/
```

### Security Issue Management
- All security vulnerabilities tracked via GitHub Issues with `security` label
- Automated vulnerability assessment and prioritization
- Systematic resolution tracking and verification
- Security-focused branch protection and review requirements
