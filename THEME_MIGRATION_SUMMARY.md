- **LCARS - Voy** (`lcars_voy`) - Star Trek: Voyager theme  
- **LCARS - TNG-E** (`lcars_tng_e`) - Star Trek: Enterprise theme

### 3. Files Modified

#### **`src/api/themes.py`** - **COMPLETELY REWRITTEN**
- Removed all references to old LCARS themes (DS9, Voy, TNG-E)
- Simplified built-in theme extraction functionality
- Removed massive theme definition blocks (800+ lines of CSS variables)
- Now focuses on database-stored themes rather than hardcoded definitions
- Kept essential built-in themes: Default, Cyber, VaporWave, LCARS-TNG

#### **`src/database/init_db.py`** - **ENHANCED**
- Added `init_built_in_themes()` function
- Automatically creates the four new themes during database initialization
- Themes are marked as `is_built_in=True` and `is_public=True`
- Owned by admin user for proper permissions
- Integrated into main `initialize_database()` function

### 4. Migration Files Created

#### **`final_theme_migration.sql`**
- Complete SQL script for manual database migration
- Removes old LCARS theme customizations
- Adds new themes with full JSON theme data
- Can be run directly against MySQL database

#### **`migrate_themes.py`**
- Python migration script (alternative to SQL)
- Handles database connections and theme creation
- Includes error handling and duplicate prevention

## Architecture Changes

### Theme System Flow (Updated)

1. **Built-in CSS Themes**: Default, Cyber, VaporWave, LCARS-TNG
   - Loaded from CSS files in frontend
   - Managed by themes API with simplified definitions
   - No database storage required

2. **Built-in Database Themes**: LCARS (New), Punk '77, TARDIS, MTV
   - Stored in `custom_themes` table with `is_built_in=True`
   - Created automatically during database initialization
   - Full CSS variable definitions in JSON format

3. **Custom User Themes**: User-created themes
   - Stored in `custom_themes` table with `is_built_in=False`
   - Can be public or private
   - Created through themes interface

### Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Cleaner API Code**: Removed 800+ lines of hardcoded CSS variables
2. **Automatic Installation**: New themes installed during DB initialization
3. **Consistent Management**: All themes use same database structure
4. **Easy Maintenance**: New themes can be added through database migrations
5. **User Experience**: Rich, thematic color schemes with proper contrast

## Installation Instructions

### For New Installations
No action required - themes will be created automatically during database initialization.

### For Existing Installations

**Option 1: SQL Migration (Recommended)**
```bash
mysql -u mvidarr -p mvidarr < final_theme_migration.sql
```

**Option 2: Python Migration**
```bash
python3 migrate_themes.py
```

**Option 3: Manual Database Initialization**
- Stop MVidarr application
- Run database initialization to trigger theme creation
- Restart MVidarr application

## Verification

After migration, users should see:
- 4 new built-in themes in the themes selection interface
- Old LCARS variants (DS9, Voy, TNG-E) no longer available
- Existing LCARS-TNG theme still available
- All new themes functional with proper color schemes

## Theme Preview

Users can access the new themes through:
1. Settings â†’ Themes
2. Select any of the new themes: LCARS (New), Punk '77, TARDIS, or MTV
3. Preview and apply themes in real-time
4. Create custom variations using the theme editor

## Notes

- Old LCARS theme customizations (user-created versions) are removed during migration
- Original LCARS-TNG theme remains available as a CSS-based theme
- All new themes support both the theme interface and can be used as base themes for customization
- Theme data is stored as JSON in the database for easy modification and extension
