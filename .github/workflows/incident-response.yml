        - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
        - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
        - **Service Level Target**: 99.9% availability
        
        ## Recovery Steps
        1. **Eradication**
           - Remove security threats
           - Patch vulnerabilities
           - Clean affected systems
        
        2. **System Recovery**
           - Restore from clean backups (if needed)
           - Rebuild affected components
           - Verify system integrity
        
        3. **Validation**
           - Security testing
           - Functionality verification
           - Performance validation
        
        4. **Monitoring**
           - Enhanced monitoring period (48 hours)
           - Continuous security assessment
           - User experience monitoring
        
        ## Success Criteria
        - [ ] All security threats eliminated
        - [ ] System functionality restored
        - [ ] Performance within normal parameters
        - [ ] Security monitoring confirms clean state
        
        ## Rollback Plan
        - Maintain current containment measures if recovery fails
        - Return to previous known-good state
        - Implement alternative solutions
