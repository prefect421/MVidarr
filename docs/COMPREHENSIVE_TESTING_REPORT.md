## Failure Analysis: Download Issues

The "Download All Wanted" functionality is now **working correctly**. The failures are legitimate and expected:

### Failure Categories Identified:
1. **Malformed Video Titles** (6 videos)
   - Examples: "No Sleep Till Brooklyn f616", "All Yourn (Lyric Video)f399"
   - **Status**: Requires manual cleanup - NOT a system bug
   
2. **Age-Restricted Content** (3 videos)  
   - Examples: "Smoking Weed Alone", "Jesus He Knows Me"
   - **Status**: Platform limitation - requires authentication setup
   
3. **No URLs Available** (8 videos)
   - **Status**: Videos missing source URLs - requires manual URL assignment

**Conclusion**: The download system is working as designed. Failures are due to data quality issues, not system bugs.
