- Added "🖼️ Manage Thumbnail" button to video edit modal
- Added full thumbnail management modal with search capabilities
- Added all JavaScript functions (openVideoThumbnailManager, searchVideoThumbnails, etc.)
- Fixed function compatibility issues with proper error/success handling
**Prevention**: Ensure UI feature parity between different templates accessing same functionality
**Impact**: High - enables video thumbnail search from video detail page, API returns 3+ thumbnail results

### [2025-01-16] BUG - Artist Video Discovery Error (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: "Error discovering videos: 'int' object has no attribute 'replace'" for artist 311 (id#:2447)
**Root Cause**: IMVDb API returns song_title as integer (311) instead of string, multiple locations expect string
**Solution**: Added str() conversion in 3 locations:
- /src/services/imvdb_service.py:496 - extract_metadata function
- /src/services/video_discovery_service.py:218,289 - video discovery processing
- /src/api/artists.py:981 - Video object creation
**Prevention**: Always validate and convert external API data types before internal processing
**Impact**: High - enables video discovery for artists with numeric names/titles, found 18 videos for artist 311

### [2025-01-17] BUG - Update from IMVDb Split Error (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Click "Update from IMVDb" returns error: 'int' object has no attribute 'split' for artists with integer slugs
**Root Cause**: IMVDb API returns slug as integer (311) but code tries to call slug.split('-') without type conversion
**Solution**: Fixed str() conversion in /src/api/artists.py:1242 - ensured slug is converted to string before split operation:
```
slug = str(slug)  # Ensure slug is a string (fix for integer slug issue)
display_name = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in slug.split('-'))
```
**Prevention**: Always validate and convert external API data types before string operations
**Impact**: High - enables IMVDb metadata search for artists with numeric slugs, now returns 4 potential matches for artist 311

### [2025-01-16] BUG - Add New Artist Results Limited (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Add New Artist search results limited to 10-20, users need 25+ for better discovery
**Root Cause**: Frontend JavaScript hardcoded limits in two locations (line 963: limit=10, line 1169: limit=20)
**Solution**: Updated frontend limits to 25 and 30 respectively in /frontend/templates/artists.html
**Prevention**: Consider making search limits configurable in settings rather than hardcoded
**Impact**: High - improves user discovery experience, now returns 25+ results instead of 10-20

### [2025-01-16] ARCH - Development Journal System Created

```python
# Before (broken):
placeholder_path = 'frontend/static/placeholder-video.png'

# After (fixed):
placeholder_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))), 'frontend/static/placeholder-video.png')
