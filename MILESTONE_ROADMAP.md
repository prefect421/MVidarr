## Milestone Success Philosophy

Following **CLAUDE.md engineering principles**:

✅ **Critical Evaluation**: Each milestone scope is challenged and optimized  
✅ **Focused Execution**: Single objective per milestone prevents scope creep  
✅ **Engineering Efficiency**: Time invested in highest-value work first  
✅ **Infrastructure First**: Solid foundation before feature development  
✅ **Quality Gates**: Testing and reliability before new features  

**Current Status**: 0.9.4 successfully completed ✅, 0.9.5 user features completed ✅, 0.9.6 QA infrastructure **ACTIVE** ⚡

**Current Action**: Phase 1 Foundation implementation (Issue #61: pytest framework) - Week 1-4 of 12-week testing infrastructure milestone.
