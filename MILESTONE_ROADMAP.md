## Milestone Success Philosophy

Following **CLAUDE.md engineering principles**:

âœ… **Critical Evaluation**: Each milestone scope is challenged and optimized  
âœ… **Focused Execution**: Single objective per milestone prevents scope creep  
âœ… **Engineering Efficiency**: Time invested in highest-value work first  
âœ… **Infrastructure First**: Solid foundation before feature development  
âœ… **Quality Gates**: Testing and reliability before new features  

**Current Status**: 0.9.4 successfully completed, solid foundation for 0.9.5 user features, comprehensive QA infrastructure planned for 0.9.6.

**Next Action**: Begin 0.9.5 user experience improvements with confidence in stable build infrastructure.
